### QA Automation 
_Mendoza, Argentina_

I am a person who likes to say that his day was productive day and that I'm closer to meeting the goals that I proposed to myself and those that we proposed as a team.

I do not like to feel that Iâ€™m not making any progress therefore I'm always looking for new challenges, something to learn, improving the things I do well and learning from mistakes, I adapt well to any team whether large or small, local or remote and my level of English has allowed me to communicate smoothly with clients and members of the team.

Currently I'm aiming more strongly to an Automation career therefore Iâ€™m taking courses to improve my skills in the matter and trying to learn as much as possible of the projects in i'm involved.
